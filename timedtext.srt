1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,840
okay so now we should be recording so

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:13,139
what you do is you've got your SRT file

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,529
uploaded and you go to the wrench and

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,369
you choose to clear the timing so what

5
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,119
that's going to do is it's going to

6
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:24,180
preserve all the little bits of text but

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,519
it's going to erase how they're timed so

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,529
I'm going to clear the timing you're

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,150
sure you want to do this yep I want to

10
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,740
do that so now you see it's a little

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,770
different color it's kind of

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,420
cream-colored instead of light and now

13
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:39,420
what it's going to do is it's going to

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,210
take those it's going to take those

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,640
subtitles that are existing and every

16
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,239
time I press the down arrow it's going

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,920
to start a new one so the trick is and

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,890
it took me a time going through it to

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,789
get it but here's the subtitle on the

20
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,430
screen and what I'm watching for is I'm

21
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:02,309
listening for him to say this last word

22
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,979
and when he says that last word I hit

23
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:06,720
the down arrow and that will start then

24
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,360
that will pull the next that will end

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,970
this one and start the next one does

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,159
that make sense

27
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:16,159
so listen to what I'm when I'm watching

28
00:01:52,820 --> 00:02:11,049
and that makes sense I'm doing it caused

29
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,700
by the ingestion

30
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:16,400
pericardial mesothelioma is so rarest

31
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,230
form of mesothelioma that is frequently

common makes up 75% of all mesothelioma

43
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,980
cases it is a tumor that affects the

feel free to ask about a clinical trial

69
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,560
led by doctor forecast skill

70
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,660
so that makes sense how that went so now

71
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,250
there's timings but you noticed in the

72
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,990
beginning it didn't quite it didn't

73
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:17,040
start like I was expecting it to start

74
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:23,400
right so you can still go back now and

75
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:27,790
chain so this should be here right

76
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,770
cancer tree disease so these first few

77
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,830
were messed up and why I didn't why it

78
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:42,970
did that that way I don't know but it

79
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:45,070
got better pretty quick but so now again

80
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:51,940
I'm looking at the layer of tissue that

81
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:56,760
covers many of the body's organs the

82
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,760
heart that's I must have been

83
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:28,140
so now we got into the rhythm and we're

84
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:30,750
and we're good so now the timings are

85
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,630
now the timings are right and what you

86
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:36,060
can do is now that we're making the

87
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,700
second pass now you can actually make

88
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,710
the corrections in the in the English if

89
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,270
it's if it's bad and you can fix the

90
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,610
timings if you notice something doesn't

91
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:47,400
start right but I know when we've done

92
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,930
in the past those timings were all off

93
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,810
right you'd have to slide them around

94
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:54,450
for everything and you were always

95
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,100
trying to get ahead of it but it would

96
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,170
never let you so you're always having to

97
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,840
pull everything back and it was a it was

98
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,880
a tremendous pain so clearing the

99
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,680
timings and then just retiming it I

100
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,130
think is the best probably the best way

101
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,750
to start it's horrible if it's a if it's

102
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,400
a half an hour video it means you sit

103
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:14,370
there for half an hour listening to it

104
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,770
and hitting down every time it or any

105
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,480
time it does it but it is the best way I

106
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,520
mean it'll take longer than half an hour

107
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,100
to fix the timings if they're off and

108
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:27,570
it's better to start with something than

109
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:31,050
starting with nothing so it's kind of a

110
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:32,700
long process but it's doing it this way

111
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,170
I think it's not as long as it would be

112
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,470
if you do it the other way

113
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:40,710
does that make sense so in a closed the

114
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:43,130
recording oh yeah yeah that's good so

115
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,130
that I guess
