00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,530
Hi. It's Mr. Andersen. Over a million people
every year develop cancer. There are over

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:16,510
a hundred different types of cancer. But many
people don't really know what is cancer? And

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:21,009
the answer to that question is very simple.
If we look at a normal cell, on the inside

5
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:26,470
of the cell is the nuclei. And that contains
DNA. And the DNA contains genes that control

6
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,499
the actions of the cell. And one of those
important actions is how a cell makes a copy

7
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:34,820
of itself. How it goes through what we call
the cell cycle. And so if you take a normal

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:39,629
cell and put it in culture it will simply
make a copy of itself. And if there's room

9
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,239
those cells will make copies of themselves
and they'll keep doing that until they fill

10
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:48,579
up that area. And if one of these cells dies
then an adjacent cell is going to jump into

11
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:53,420
that cell cycle and it's going to fill that
hole. And so that's how you went from a zygote

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,170
to the trillions of cells that are inside
your body. And that's also how you replace

13
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,870
cells. And so your skin is constantly losing
cells off the surface. But we're creating

14
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:08,970
cells underneath that. And so the cause of
all cancers is the same. There is going to

15
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,700
be damage to the DNA. And so that DNA is made
up of what are called nucleotides. And there

16
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,050
are tons of genes in there that are controlling
this cell cycle. When a cell should make a

17
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:24,250
copy of itself and when it should stop dividing.
And so a mutation is simply damage to that

18
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,510
DNA. Now it could just occur spontaneously.
If we all live long enough we're all going

19
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:33,650
to develop cancer because these mutations
are going to start to accrue during our life

20
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:39,200
time. But we can also increase the rate of
those mutations using the environment. And

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,420
so for example if we smoke cigarettes that
could cause mutations to the DNA. Increases

22
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:49,940
in UV radiation. We're finding decreases in
exercise. Increases in certain types of diet

23
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:55,450
can cause mutations. And that can cause problems
in the cell cycle. And so let's say we get

24
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,530
a mutation in this cell right here. There
are going to be genes within that cell that

25
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:03,310
sense something is wrong. And lots of times
it will undergo apoptosis where that cell

26
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:09,750
dies and another cell moves inside. But during
our lifetime we start to accrue more and more

27
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,350
mutations. And eventually enough mutations
build in one of those cells and it becomes

28
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,550
not a normal cell but a cancerous cell. And
this takes a long time for that to occur.

29
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,420
And so this is a pretty awful graph. This
is the increase in the popularity of cigarettes.

30
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,560
And so this is the number of cigarette smoking
per person per year. And so as they were doing

31
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,080
that they were increasing the mutations inside
their body. And we can look decades later,

32
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,200
we see the causation. We can see an increase
in lung cancer in men as well. And so as we

33
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,740
make those mistakes in our cell we form these
cancerous cells. Now what does a cancerous

34
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,150
cell do? It doesn't matter that there are
cells around it. It is simply going to divide

35
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,520
and divide and divide. Over and over and over
again. And eventually what you create is a

36
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,190
tumor. Now there are two types of tumor. If
those cells are restricted to that one area

37
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:06,050
and stay within a membrane we call those benign
tumors. And that's not cancer. But if there

38
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,180
is no restriction to that area it becomes
what's called a malignant tumor. And that's

39
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,290
really a definition of what cancer is. It's
when we have these uncontrolled cell growth

40
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:20,459
and those cells show uncontrolled cell growth
spread throughout our body. And so this is

41
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:26,040
a video of some cancerous cells. And so instead
of just growing and doing the jobs of the

42
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,360
cell, you can see they are kind of misshapen.
And all they do is make copies of themselves

43
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,930
and copies of themselves over and over and
over again. That's where all of the energy

44
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,930
is going. Now if that was restricted to one
area it wouldn't be as big a deal. But they

45
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,380
can move to different areas of the body. And
so if we have a tumor right here, it can start

46
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,290
to invade the tissues around it. And so that
tumor can not only get larger, but it can

47
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,849
move into new areas. And if that tumor gets
into the lymphatic system or the circulatory

48
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:57,650
system, it can move around our body and it
can settle somewhere else. And so that's the

49
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,739
problem with a malignant tumor. And so we
name cancers based on the tissues and the

50
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:06,550
organs that they infect. So this would be
lung cancer. But we could also have colon

51
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:11,420
cancer. Or maybe pancreatic cancer or breast
cancer. It's basically named on the tissue

52
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,389
of where it is. Now each of those cancers,
even though the cause is the same, damage

53
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:21,669
to the DNA which produces uncontrolled cell
growth, the way they manifest the disease

54
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:25,270
is going to be totally different. And so if
you look at this x-ray we can see that this

55
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,539
is somebody who has lung cancer. And there's
going to be a tumor right there. And what

56
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:34,960
we're finding is not only are all these different
types cancer different, but each of those

57
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,909
individual tumors are different. And between
two people those tumors are going to be different.

58
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:43,569
And even within the cells of the tumor they're
going to be different. And so what does that

59
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:48,580
mean? Well even though we might treat one
tumor, we're going to find that within that

60
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,659
tumor there are going to be different cells.
Each of those have different genetic problems.

61
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:57,889
And so we could treat most of the tumor, remove
most of it, but it is going to come back eventually

62
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:03,580
over time. And so what do we have for treatments?
And so since cancer is uncontrolled cell growth

63
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,770
we want to find those cells and quickly as
we can. And so screening is the most important

64
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:12,330
thing. Once we find that cancer has developed
and we find that tumor, the first thing that

65
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:17,080
we want to do is we want to remove that. And
so surgery is generally what happens next.

66
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,949
We remove that tumor. We also use radiation.
In other words we're not going to be able

67
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:26,099
to remove all of those cell. There are going
to be extraneous cells around it. And so we

68
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:31,289
can target this with ionizing radiation. And
we can kill all those cells. Now this has

69
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:36,249
dangers as well. And so we try to restrict
that to that one area. But it can cause damage

70
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:40,969
to the cells around it. And then often times
we'll use chemotherapy. Now what is chemotherapy

71
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:45,719
doing? It's going throughout your whole body.
And it is targeting cells that are actively

72
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:50,159
dividing. Cells that are going through this
cell cycle. And so that's why it affects,

73
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:54,009
for example, you get a lot of nausea. Because
it's affecting those cells in your digestive

74
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:58,319
tract. Or you lose your hair because it is
affecting those cells that are quickly making,

75
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,909
that are constantly making new hair. And so
with all of these we're getting better and

76
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:09,089
better at treating cancer. What's the future
hold? Well we're really just treating just

77
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:13,719
all cancers with these three methods the same.
And so what we'll see is if we can get into

78
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:18,469
the genetics and we start to understand how
each of those cancers are different then we

79
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:22,749
can start to target them. And so one of the
breakthroughs was Gleevec which is one of

80
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:28,289
these first drugs that's targeting a specific
type of leukemia. And it was affecting a specific

81
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:33,490
machinery within that cell. And so again,
the more we understand about cancer we find

82
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,689
that they are all the same but the causes
are going to be different. And so what is

83
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:44,689
cancer? It's simply uncontrolled cell growth.
And I hope that was helpful.
