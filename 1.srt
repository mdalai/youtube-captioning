dysregulated map case signaling has been

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,370
implicated in a wide range of cancers

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,980
and occurs via multiple mechanisms

00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,960
including activation of receptors and

5
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,240
activating chaos and b-raf mutations

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,490
these may lead to increased or

mech and erk also known as map cake map

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,480
case signaling is activated through

17
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,309
binding of a growth factor to the

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,820
extracellular domain of the tyrosine
